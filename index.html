          I am a 50-yr-old, full-stack web developer born and raised in the
          greater metropolitan area of New Orleans, Louisiana. I am a divorced
          father of a 17-yr-old son, who is attending junior college in Austin,
          Texas; where he resides full-time with his mother and stepfather.
        </p>

          Also, I am a veteran of the Louisiana Army National Guard and the
          United States Army. My unit was activated for service during Desert
          Shield/Storm from October of 1990 to June of 1991.
